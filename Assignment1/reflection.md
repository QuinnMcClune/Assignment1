This was my first assignment ever using python. It was kind of cool to be able to say that I made something in Python. The most confusing part about it was pulling the assignment, and I am sure when I push it back that will be difficult as well. Grace as very helpful as she has had some prior experience with python and I felt she helped me with any questions I had. It only took us each 10 or so mintues to do our portion of the coding. I need to familiarize myself with git and github more. Anaconda seems to be pretty easy to navigate though. I am excited for what I will learn in the future.
